This project tackles the critical issue of traffic congestion in urban areas by employing innovative spatiotemporal data analysis techniques. Recognizing the multifaceted challenges posed by traffic congestion, we develop a model that seamlessly integrates spatial insights from distance-based clustering with temporal intricacies of vehicle counts. Leveraging the power of the Density-Based Spatial Clustering (DBSCAN) algorithm and Haversine’s formula for calculating geographical distances, our approach transforms the complex road network into clusters of streets, capturing the inherent structure of traffic dynamics. The temporal dimension is then skillfully incorporated through a detailed analysis of vehicle counts, allowing us to discern peak congestion periods and identify temporal patterns indicative of varying traffic conditions. The model introduces a congestion threshold, based on quantiles obtained from the traffic data, facilitating the categorization of congestion levels. Applying this model to traffic data from the city of Aarhus, we successfully identify congestion patterns across different days of the week, providing valuable insights for transportation management and urban planning. The results showcase the model’s accuracy in identifying congestion, with specific validation on a major highway confirming its authenticity. This project stands at the intersection of transportation engineering, data science, and urban planning, offering a holistic and predictive approach to address the complex challenges of traffic congestion in contemporary urban landscapes.
